These two issues—housing costs/taxes and commute time are the reasons we consider leaving Lexington in the future. "

Pool hours suck for working families.

Hate the cookie cutter housing being built - not actually affordable just makes more  money for builders.

School facilities are not good.  Teaching staff no better and perhaps worse than most other places in Mass.  kids success is entirely based on family expectation not at all on quality teaching.  We have so many crappy teachers here who instill a massive sense of boredom rather than a love of learning.  

I am so underwhelmed by lexington I don’t even have words to express it.

Our gross annual income (both parents work full time) is $155K; we spend $20K on fed/state taxes; $25K into 401Ks; $40K on the house (mtg, taxes, insurance); $55K on full time daycare for 2 children (age 3 and 1); $6K on utilities (oil, electric, phone, tv); $5K on cars (insurance, fuel, repairs, taxs; no car payments); $5K on groceries for family of 4. This leaves NEGATIVE $1K in our annual budget for EVERYTHING else (doctors, clothing, sports, activities, pets, travel (ha), entertainment, ""wants""). Almost none of the expenses are things that we can reduce the cost of if we stay in Lexington (we could get rid of cable and our phones and save $2K, but we would cry), so we are really cognizant of ANY increase in annual costs in any of these categories. Pretty much the only one that is guaranteed to increase each year are our real estate taxes (and childcare while they are still < age 5). Even a measly increase affects us adversely.  We get a (tiny) financial scholarship from our daycare to help keep costs steady year-to-year. We are essentially going in the black until our kids make it to public school - at that point our childcare will go from $55K to $10K (for lextended day) so we will finally have a little bit extra to fund our IRAs and pay for activities for our children, buy clothes, pay doctors, etc.","Some (26-50%)","Yes","Unlikely","31-39 years","4","none of the above","moved in 2010-2014","single family home","$750,000-$999,999","$150,000-$199,999","Joe Pato's facebook page","Young families are priced out of this town - most houses below $700K end up as tear downs, and that's about the max house value a family like mine can afford (or not truly afford in our case! but at least make work somehow).

We understand that takes money and have no issue with the level of town taxes.  However, for the money we are paying, we are disappointed in what we're hearing so far of the math program at Harrington Elementary.  Our daughter just started kindergarten there and many, many parents with older kids in the same school tell us that no only is the current level of math instruction going to say that way for the rest of the year, but that it doesn't get much better by 5th grade.  Most of the parents supplement with Russian School of math.  That's expensive and we'll do it but it's painful to think we have to do that after specifically moving to Lexington for the school system and doubling our mortgage in the process.  Just to clarify: my five year old can count to a hundred and do addition and subtraction, just from having been playing a math game on my phone on her own initiative.  At the back to school night, we were told they are currently learning to count to ten, will move on to twenty by mid-year and will touch on addition by year's end.  Why does this matter to the money discussion?  Because we don't want to see taxes cut so much as to ensure that the money we already pay results in a high quality of town services."

This would encourage a greater mix of income levels and professions in town, as well as ensuring the Town still has some properties with <4000 sq ft that are reasonable to heat when the price of fuel oil finally hits $10/gallon. Yes, it sounds like this would be a money losing idea for the town, however I would see it as either an investment or insurance for when the value of the McMansions finally plummet and no one is willing to buy them any longer.

We should also provide housing and studio opportunities for artists. Places like Somerville and Cambridge are so vibrant, and part of that stems from the wonderful mill buildings that have been converted into artist space. Artists would infuse the Lexington community with life, creativity, fun, and excitement - all things which are lamentably missing from our town!"

Large families move in for the school system, but their local taxes don't pay the extra cost of putting their children through the schools here. The tax burden gets placed on empty-nesters and retirees. It's a dynamic that will drive out those who cannot afford to stay here, no matter what town bells and whistles are built, like a state-of-the-art community center and theatre.

After 46 yrs of paying taxes, raising my children here, I am forced to look for housing elsewhere in order to downsize and to adjust to my new retirement income.  The problem is very complicated since there is such an overwhelming ""international"" influence in the town population, as well.  If there is affordable housing, outside of Muzzey, the information is extremely difficult to access and not kept in one central location/office with clear and direct procedures.  Other neighboring towns, like Concord, have done much more in this regard.   I have been terribly disilusioned.    "

And then the town could perhaps have a lottery system for that home for local employees that might not be available to afford a home in the town, otherwise.  I grew up here and the town was significantly more economically diverse.  Allowing builders to consistently tear down reasonable sized homes and put too big a home on too small a lot has caused most of this. TM and the Town need to have much more strict lot/house size limits and there should be HARSH (Like 5-10% selling price) penalties for builders who exceed lot limits, set backs, etc.  There's too much ""i know everyone in town government"" so i can get away with whatever.

All three neighbors are moving out of town within the next 3 to 5 years because of it.  I will have to as well. As their neighbor I am concerned when I see any piece of property over 1/2 acre being built with condos to two, three or multiple homes. Due to the substantially increased amount of building we fear additional and substantial property tax increases. This will make it impossible for us to remain here for the long term. I understand we need new schools and police and fire stations but they are inevitably over built. Estabrook does not use it’s indoor greenhouse for example -just one small example among many others. The size of the new Hastings Elementary school while understanding we are planning for future population growth seems again excessive."

The town has been delinquent in not creating other revenue streams, or properties other than residences,  which will create higher tax payments, such as the development of Hartwell Ave. I also believe that the development of very high cost housing stock has created a town of a different nature from the one that existed when I moved here, with a reputation for being a ""rich town"" rather than a ""modest"" one. Living in a ""rich"" town with little economic diversity is extremely negative to me. I was disappointed, for example, that my 4 children, who were born here, grew up and were educated here, could not afford to buy a home and live here despite reasonable family incomes.

It is distressing to me to see the town spend mega millions on new town facilities, however necessary, without exploring potential cost savings, such as regional facilities, rehabbing the old ones, etc. Just build and damn the cost!"

We liked the feel of this small neighborhood and are disturbed that these big houses are changing the feel. More importantly, we're losing a lot of older housing stock that was more affordable and we're turning into an expensive neighborhood that only wealthy people can afford to buy into. Not what we were looking for when we moved here. Additionally, we're losing green space (back yards) and trees as these are cut down and paved over to accommodate the large houses that extend as far as possible to the lot line and are built as tall as possible. It makes for a less appealing view and less privacy and sunlight in our house. The quality of life here is diminished as a result. "
